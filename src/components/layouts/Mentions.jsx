					desc="VCET Hackathon is an annual hackathon competition held at Vidyavardhiniâ€™s College of Engineering and Technology. I participated in this Hackathon with three of my other friends. The rules differed slightly from previous years. This year the organisers decided the topics for the participants. This code sprint lasted for thirty hours, during which we developed an application named Classmate. After three jury rounds, we were amongst the top 10 teams to qualify for the final judging round. The last round was the pitching round, where we shared our inspiration, workflow and the future of the Classmate. In the event conclusion, our team was in the fourth position amongst all the 45+ participants."
